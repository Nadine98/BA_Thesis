# Performance Comparison of RDF and LPG graphs for the Construction Industry

Two experiments are conducted: 
  - Experiment 1: Retrieving data from graphs
  - Experiment 2: Creating, updating and deleting data from graphs

For both experiments four IFC Models are used which are represented in RDF and LPG graphs. All graphs are stored in Neo4j, for storing RDF graphs in Neo4j a plugin (neosemantic) is used. All queries are written in Cypher
